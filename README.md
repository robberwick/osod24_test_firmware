# OSoD24 Firmware

This is the firmware for the OSoD24 project, built for our entry in the [PiWars 2024](https://piwars.org/) competition. 
It is based on the Pico-SDK and the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html).

## Building

To build the firmware, you will need to install the following:
- Pico-SDK. Instructions for this can be found in the ["Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico" PDF document](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf).
- Pimoroni Pico libraries. See [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico)

## Documentation

Documentation for the firmware can be found in the [docs](docs) folder.
